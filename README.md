# Swagger - Telosys 3 Template

Use this [Telosys](http://www.telosys.org/) template to generate a working Swagger file (YAML or JSON) matching your entities specifications.  
Swagger is a framework of API developer tools for the API Specification.

## Generated files

This template provides you with two kind of generated files :
* ENTITY swagger Json file : this file can be used with [swagger io on line](https://swagger.io/swagger-ui/) or with local tools.  
* ENTITY swagger Yaml file : this file can be used with [swagger editor on line](http://editor.swagger.io/#/) or with local tools.  

#### Note

Telosys generates a file for every entity but Swagger can only manage one file at a time. You must choose what entity will be displayed in the Swagger tool.
